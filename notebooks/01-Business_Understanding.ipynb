    "## description:\n",
    "The Breast Cancer dataset [1] is a widely used dataset for learning and practicing machine learning techniques. It contains diagnostic data for breast cancer cases, including features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, and smoothness, and are compiled into a convenient dataset.\n",
    "## Goal:\n",
    "Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign.\n",

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "* Diagnosis of breast tumors is traditionally done with a complete biopsy, which is invasive.\n",
    "* FNA (fine needle aspiration) is less invasive, but diagnosis is not always successful and remains highly dependent on the skill and experience of the physician, meaning it is a subjective process.\n",
    "* So the main question: how to make FNA diagnosis faster, more accurate, and more objective so that it is less dependent on individual judgment."
