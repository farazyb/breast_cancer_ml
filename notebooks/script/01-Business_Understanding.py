# # Breast Cancer
# ## description:
# The Breast Cancer dataset [1] is a widely used dataset for learning and practicing machine learning techniques. It contains diagnostic data for breast cancer cases, including features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. These features describe characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, and smoothness, and are compiled into a convenient dataset.
# ## Goal:
# Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify breast cancer cases as malignant or benign.

# ## Business Understanding
# ### Problem
# * Diagnosis of breast tumors is traditionally done with a complete biopsy, which is invasive.
# * FNA (fine needle aspiration) is less invasive, but diagnosis is not always successful and remains highly dependent on the skill and experience of the physician, meaning it is a subjective process.
# * So the main question: how to make FNA diagnosis faster, more accurate, and more objective so that it is less dependent on individual judgment.
